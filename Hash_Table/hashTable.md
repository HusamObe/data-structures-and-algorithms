# Hash Table

> after solving code challenge:

- Understand the implementation of a Hashtable data structure.

- Learn how to handle collisions using separate chaining.

- Implement the 'set', 'get', 'has', 'keys', and 'hash' methods for the Hashtable.

- Explored the concept of a Hashtable and its importance in data storage and retrieval.

- Successfully implemented the hash method to generate the hash code for keys.

- Implemented the set method to add key-value pairs to the Hashtable and handle collisions using separate chaining.

- Understanding the concept of hashing and resolving collisions required deeper research.

- Handling edge cases while implementing the set method was a bit challenging.
