## Whiteboard Process
![alt text](./intersection%20nodes.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
-  Time Complexity:O(N + M), where N is the number of nodes in the first binary tree, and M is the number of nodes in the second binary tree. The algorithm traverses each tree once..
- Space Complexity: O(N) because we use a hashtable to store the encountered words

## Solution
 inside the code
