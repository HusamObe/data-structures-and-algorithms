# Trees Vs Binary Trees

* In Python, a tree is a general data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have zero or more child nodes. It is a hierarchical structure that represents a set of linked nodes.

* On the other hand, a binary tree is a specific type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child. The binary tree has a special property where the left child is less than or equal to the parent node, and the right child is greater than the parent node. This property makes binary trees useful for efficient searching and sorting operations.

```
In summary, a binary tree is a type of tree data structure, but not all trees are binary trees. Binary trees have specific rules and constraints regarding the number of child nodes a node can have, while general trees can have any number of child nodes per node.
